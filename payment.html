	- the benefiting organization
	- general summary of run
	- "Registration for the event ends on [date], so if you'd like to participate in a fun-filled event
	   that benefits [whoever the org benefits] then register now!" (hyperlink "register now" to Register page)
	- include link to Contact Us page at bottom

	- where/when
	- cost (include link to Register page)

		- where the cops are
		- water stations (?)
		- first aid stations (?)
		- volunteers: include info on where they are and what they look like
	- after the run

Register page
	- "If you have already registered and need to pay, please click here." (hyperlink "here" to Pay page)
	- "Clicking Submit will redirect you to Paypal in order to pay. Please note that your registration is not
	   complete until payment is received."
	- name form
	- user email address form
	- submit button/paypal button
		- in form processing block, create entry in json array first and then proceed
			- if user already exists
				- redirect to Register page and print error message
				- and print "If you have already registered and need to pay, please click here." (hyperlink "here" to Pay page)
			- else if user or email contains invalid chars, redirect to Register page and print error message
			- else proceed

		- if paypal payment successfully sent and received: "We will email you once we receive confirmation
		  of your payment. Thank you!" (see logistics)
		  	- update paid flag in json array
		- else "Problems with paying? Please contact us." (hyperlink "contact us" to Contact Us page)

	- "We do not store any financial information. We will never contact you with unsolicited goods or services."

Pay page (HIDDEN)
	- name form
	- user email address form
	- submit button/paypal button
		- in form processing block, check json array
			- if user not found
				- redirect to Register page
				- print error message
			- else proceed

		- if paypal payment successfully sent and received: "We will email you once we receive confirmation
		  of your payment. Thank you!" (see logistics)
		  	- update paid flag in json array
		- else "Problems with paying? Please contact us." (hyperlink "contact us" to Contact Us page)

Contact Us page

	- "Would you like to make a donation? Have any general questions or concerns? Having
	   problems with paying or the site? Please contact us using the form below and we
	   will get back to you as soon as possible. Thanks!"

	- contact email address form
	- subject form
	- text body form
	- send button
	- "We will never contact you with unsolicited goods or services."

LOGISTICS

Register page
	- check if user has already registered (use name and email)
		- multiple users on the same email acct are allowed, but only allow one registration at a time (also helps in case refund is needed)
	- need to store name, email, bib/unique number, paid flag (phone number?)
		- sql database not possible; no server-side code allowed
		- easiest would be use json array and store local copy in repo (risky, but at least repo is private)
			- email updated copy of array to master gmail account at end of each day
			- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6281963/how-to-build-a-json-array-from-mysql-database
		- last ditch resort: configure to send email to master gmail account and manually update records
		- https://github.com/b03tz/FormSave/issues/11
	- determining if payment successfully received
		- update json array of users; set paid flag
		- keep internal copy of total amount raised?
			- could put donation total up on Home page ("Together we've raised $$$ for [org]" motivational shit)
		- check if paypal has some mechanism for this
